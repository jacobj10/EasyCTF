Obfuscated (400)

Problem

How good are you at reading Python? Put your Python skills to the test by finding the password that passes this check: obfuscated.py
Note: easyctf{} formatting is not required for this problem.
Hint

Note: there may be multiple correct answers. The grader runs the same code that's in the given file.

OK. So reading this program in Gedit, you see it is:
#asdkasldkjasklda
